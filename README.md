# Will's World

iOS game attempting to simulate Chip's Challenge.

I wanted to play Chip's Challenge on the go and didn't find anything, so I wrote this.

The game engine is not at all faithful to the original; it's half Lynx, half MS, half neither.

It was close enough to be able to play through (most?) Lynx-compatible levels.

This code is obsolete, undocumented, unsupported, unsanctioned, unreadable, and unpalatable. Enter at your own risk.
